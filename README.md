## About ZD (myself) ðŸ’¬
I'm a **cmdline** _geek_, and spends most of my time in learning things, such as: - *Network security (TCP/IP), Coding (in Android apps, Python/Ruby, Markdown), Clouds (Google/Azure/AWS), Containers (Kubernetes/docker, LCX), IoT (ESP8266 and Raspberry Pi), vim and zsh/bash*. 

At my free time :hourglass_flowing_sand:, I would *wandering around with my motorcycle* :motorcycle:; *flying my Mavic Mini* :helicopter:; *enjoying my drinks* :wine_glass: + :beers:, and *reading books* :books:.
